# Virtual Store
Virtual stores are a display of supermarket products, each labeled with a barcode, on walls
of vital places like public transport stations, and users can do their shopping on the go by
scanning the barcode of the products on display using our smartphone app, and place their
orders to be home delivered to them at the wanted time and address.
Virtual stores will help retailers expand their business at minimal cost. No more huge areas
of land and high expenses needed for opening a new branch, with our smartphone app, all
you need to open a new branch is a wall and a delivery service!
It'll also make the shopping experience easier for the public and nobody will need to reserve
some time in their schedule for shopping anymore. Moreover, it will be an additional source
of national income at no cost, since non-exploited walls of governmental places like public
transport stations, universities, etc. can be rented for retailers to display their products on.
